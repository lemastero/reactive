/**
 * Keeps a list of strong references. Used to control when observers
 * can be garbage collected. The observable uses weak references to hold
 * the observers, so that observers aren't retained in memory for the
 * entire lifetime of the observable.
 * Therefore, to make sure the observer isn't garbage collected too early, a
 * reference to it is stored in an Observing.
 * Usage: Most methods that add observers to an observable take an Observing
 * as an implicit parameter, so usually you put an implicit Observing in
 * the scope in question, and make sure it lasts as long as you need the
 * observers to last. You can do this by having the containing class
 * extends Observing (it contains an implicit pointing to itself), or
 * by writing
 * implicit val observing = new Observing {}
 * or the like. You can also pass an Observing instance explicitly to
 * any method that takes one, bypassing the implicit resolution mechanism.
